In August 2019 Rebecca Wearn and the data unit's Rob England [reported on the cost of school uniforms](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-49090913).

The BBC compared school clothing on the websites of four large UK supermarkets and found the average prices were about £58 less for a primary school uniform and £118 less for a secondary school uniform than in the government's survey of parents.

The story also involved scraping a sample of 100 Facebook groups set up in Britain containing the words "school uniform" and "swap" or "free", and looked at how much some councils spent on school uniform grants.
